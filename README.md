Whatsapp-web.js is an unofficial, open-source library that isn't made by WhatsApp or affiliated with it in any way. This library is designed to offer developers the freedom to create WhatsApp clients, chatbots, applications, and more using node.js.

The library works by launching the WhatsApp Web browser application and managing it using Puppeteer to create an instance of WhatsApp Web, thereby mitigating the risk of being blocked. The WhatsApp API client connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app, accessing its internal functions. This grants you access to nearly all the features available on WhatsApp Web, enabling dynamic handling similar to any other Node.js application.

While it's possible to begin with limited JavaScript and programming knowledge, attempting to create a bot without a solid grasp of the language may result in frustration. You may encounter challenges with basic tasks, find it difficult to solve simple problems, and end up feeling discouraged.
